9. Testing and benchmarking
- Testing is built into the language and Go provides all the tooling you need.
- The go test tool is used to run tests.
- Test files always end with the _test.go file name.
- Table tests are a great way to leverage a single test function to test multiple values.
- Examples are both tests and documentation for a package.
- Benchmarks provide a mechanism to reveal the performance of code.
